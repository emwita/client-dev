            I am a study abroad student. I came to the US to learn English and to take two semesters of Computer Science undergraduate classes. This semester is my last one at Loyola. I have experience as a web developer. A couple years ago I worked for a company for 3 years in my hometown developing a single page web application. In this job I acquired experience with technologies such as PHP, HTML, CSS, Javascript, MySql and PostgreSql. This semester I am also taking Web Services class, this class class has helped me a lot to develop my skills with web development working with Java and REST APIs.
